     <p>
      I understood that react is a class like any class in a game 
      its like the main is 3 things part of something called "the components"
      
     </p>
     <p>
     - button    
     </p>
     <p>
      - text   
     </p>
     <p>
      - view   
     </p>
     <p>
      these are the main things......   
     </p>
     <p>
      then there is a command called render which is basically the display with a
      bracket involved   
     </p>
     <p>
      then you can give colour to the button and space it in the display screen of the
      smartphone   
     </p>

    <p>
     its is worth listening to whatever boring part is there becausse you can actually
      make an app !    
    </p>
